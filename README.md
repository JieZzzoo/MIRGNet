# MIRGNet
This repository is about the work of Multi-level Interactive Reverse guided network for Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images.
üèÉ The code is on the way...... üèÉ

# Datasets
The dataset utilized in this study can be accessed from [BaiDuYunlink](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1iP7KRFwkS6K4Hako1XQIgg) (code:2r9f), including ORSSD, EORSSD, ORSI-4199 and RSISOD.

# Saliency maps
We provide saliency maps of our MIRGNet in [BaiDuYunlink](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1CO8xPhUwyuZ8uzVBiW0KSg)(code:MIRG) on ORSSD and EORSSD.

# Evaluation Tool
You can use the evaluation tool [(MATLAB version)](https://github.com/MathLee/MatlabEvaluationTools) to evaluate the above saliency maps.
