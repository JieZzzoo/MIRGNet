# DCRRNet
This repository is about the work of Divide and Conquer Reverse Refinement Network for Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images. The code is on the way......

# Datasets
The dataset utilized in this study can be accessed from [BaiDuYunlink](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1iP7KRFwkS6K4Hako1XQIgg) (code:2r9f). including ORSSD and EORSSD.

# Saliency maps
We provide saliency maps of our ADSTNet in [BaiDuYunlink](https://pan.baidu.com/s/17VbcRwQe4JwNIIKVFo9C9Q)(code:DCRR) on ORSSD and EORSSD.

# Evaluation Tool
You can use the evaluation tool [(MATLAB version)](https://github.com/MathLee/MatlabEvaluationTools) to evaluate the above saliency maps.


If you encounter any problems with the code, want to report bugs, etc.
