# MIRGNet
This repository is about the work of Multi-level Interactive Reverse guided network for Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images. The code is on the way......

# Datasets
The dataset utilized in this study can be accessed from [BaiDuYunlink](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1CO8xPhUwyuZ8uzVBiW0KSg) (code:MIRG). including ORSSD and EORSSD.

# Saliency maps
We provide saliency maps of our MIRGNet in [BaiDuYunlink](https://pan.baidu.com/s/17VbcRwQe4JwNIIKVFo9C9Q)(code:MIRG) on ORSSD and EORSSD.

# Evaluation Tool
You can use the evaluation tool [(MATLAB version)](https://github.com/MathLee/MatlabEvaluationTools) to evaluate the above saliency maps.
